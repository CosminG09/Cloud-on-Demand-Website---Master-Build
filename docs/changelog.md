[2025-09-04] Step 4 — MDX runtime + brand fonts + typography
- Added MDX runtime (next-mdx-remote/rsc) with remark-gfm, rehype-slug, autolink-headings
- Refactored loader: list uses front-matter; detail compiles MDX ? React
- Wired local brand fonts via next/font/local (Aileron 400/700, Audiowide 400)
- Tailwind Typography enabled; added `.font-display` utility
- Verified: /insights/primul renders JSX block; H1 uses Audiowide; body uses Aileron
- Safety: robots.txt still Disallow; sitemap is stubbed (update before launch)
